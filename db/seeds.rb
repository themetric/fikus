# We provide you a basic shell for interaction with the end user.
# So try some code like below:

#   shell.say name
#
#email     = shell.ask "Which email do you want use for loggin into admin?"
#password  = shell.ask "Tell me the password to use:"

# Let's set up some sane defaults so we don't have to ask
